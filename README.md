# A wild ping appears!

You may know me from my work on Flutter or one of many other projects:

- [Notes](https://notes.tst.sh) - A place I put my personal notes.
- [Boxy](https://boxy.wiki) - A popular package for creating complex layouts in Flutter.
- [Puro](https://puro.dev) - A high-tech version manager for Flutter.
- [DZ3](https://github.com/pingbird/dz3) - High level Dart bindings to the Z3 theorem prover.

I also do a lot of low-level systems, robotics, cybersecurity, proof assistants, and cloud infrastructure.
